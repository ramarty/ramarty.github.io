Many donors have sought to engage with this challenge by introducing environmental safeguard and monitoring initiatives; however, evidence on the success of these interventions is limited. Evaluating aid is a particular challenge in the case of donors that do not disclose information on the nature, geographic location, or extents of their interventions. In such cases, new methods that extract and geoparse data on the activities of opaque donors through the manual interpretation of thousands of news and other articles allow us to investigate the impacts of these activities. However, residual spatial uncertainty in these data remains a potential source of bias. In this article, we apply and discuss a Geographic Simulation and Extrapolation (GeoSIMEX) approach to mitigate the spatial imprecision inherent in geoparsed data. In conjunction with GeoSIMEX, we test and contrast multiple approaches to reducing the imprecision of aid, including high-assumption cases in which other covariates (i.e., nighttime lights) are leveraged to allocate aid. In our application, we find that methods which do not account for spatial imprecision find statistically significant relationships between Chinese aid and vegetation change; after accounting for spatial uncertainty, findings are similar for Rwanda and inconclusive for Burundi.\n","permalink":"https://ramarty.github.io/publications/geosimex/","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the causal impact of Chinese aid on vegetative land cover in Burundi and Rwanda under conditions of spatial imprecision"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The health sector has attracted significant foreign aid; however, evidence on the effectiveness of this support is mixed. This paper combines household panel data with geographically referenced subnational foreign aid data to investigate the contribution of health aid to health outcomes in Uganda. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that aid had a strong effect on reducing the productivity burden of disease indicated by days of productivity lost due to illness but was less effective in reducing disease prevalence. Consequently, health aid appeared to primarily quicken recovery times rather than prevent disease. In addition, we find that health aid was most beneficial to individuals who lived closest to aid projects. Apart from the impact of aid, we find that aid tended to not be targeted to localities with the worse socioeconomic conditions. Overall, the results highlight the importance of allocating aid close to subnational areas with greater need to enhance aid effectiveness.\n","permalink":"https://ramarty.github.io/publications/ugandahealthaid/","tags":null,"title":"The impact of aid on health outcomes in Uganda"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Since 1945, over $4.9 trillion dollars of international aid has been allocated to developing countries. To date, there have been no estimates of the regional impact of this aid on the carbon cycle. We apply a geographically explicit matching method to estimate the relative impact of large-scale World Bank projects implemented between 2000 and 2010 on sequestered carbon, using a novel and publicly available data set of 61,243 World Bank project locations. Considering only carbon sequestered due to fluctuations in vegetative biomass caused by World Bank projects, we illustrate the relative impact of World Bank projects on carbon sequestration. We use this information to illustrate the geographic variation in the apparent effectiveness of environmental safeguards implemented by the World Bank. We argue that sub-national data can help to identify geographically heterogeneous impact effects, and highlight many remaining methodological challenges.\n","permalink":"https://ramarty.github.io/publications/carbonsequestration/","tags":null,"title":"A Top-Down Approach to Estimating Spatially Heterogeneous Impacts of Development Aid on Vegetative Carbon Sequestration"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Objective: Cross-national studies provide inconclusive results as to the effectiveness of foreign health aid. We highlight a novel application of using subnational data to evaluate aid impacts, using Malawi as a case study.\nDesign: We employ two rounds of nationally representative household surveys (2004\u0026frasl;2005 and 2010\u0026frasl;2011) and geo-referenced foreign aid data. We examine the determinants of Malawi\u0026rsquo;s traditional authorities receiving aid according to health, environmental risk, socioeconomic and political factors. We use two approaches to estimate the impact of aid on reducing malaria prevalence and increasing healthcare quality: difference-in-difference models, which include traditional authority and month-of-interview fixed effects and control for individual and household level time-varying factors, and entropy balancing, where models balance on health-related and socioeconomic baseline characteristics. General health aid and four specific health aid sectors are examined.\nResults: Traditional authorities with greater proportions of individuals living in urban areas, more health facilities and greater proportions of those in major ethnic groups were more likely to receive aid. Difference-in-difference models show health infrastructure and parasitic disease control aid reduced malaria prevalence by 1.20 (95% CI −0.36 to 2.76) and 2.20 (95% CI 0.43 to 3.96) percentage points, respectively, and increased the likelihood of individuals reporting healthcare as more than adequate by 12.1 (95% CI 1.51 to 22.68) and 14.0 (95% CI 0.11 to 28.11) percentage points. Entropy balancing shows similar results.\nConclusions: Aid was targeted to areas with greater existing health infrastructure rather than areas most in need, but still effectively reduced malaria prevalence and enhanced self-reported healthcare quality.\n","permalink":"https://ramarty.github.io/publications/malawihealthaid/","tags":null,"title":"Taking the health aid debate to the subnational level: the impact and allocation of foreign health aid in Malawi"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The study utilizes survival analysis methodology to examine unemployment duration in Uganda’s five regions. The analysis is developed on a database of cohorts of the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) for the year 2005\u0026frasl;06 and the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) for the years 2009\u0026frasl;10, 2010\u0026frasl;11 and 2011\u0026frasl;12. This work analyses individuals’ first spell of unemployment using the Kaplan Meier estimator of the survival functions in unemployment and the covariate effects on duration using the Cox Proportional Hazard Model. Results suggest that over 12 months cohorts in the Eastern and Northern regions face longer spells of unemployment with a 0.85 probability of unemployment. However, in the long run and with the exception of Western Uganda, unemployment duration in all regions is not statistically different from that of Kampala. Cohorts with higher education gain employment slower than those with less education across all regions. Women exit unemployment much slower than men if the unemployment duration is less than 12 months and much faster where the duration is longer than a year. Exit from unemployment increases with age. Investments to curb unemployment should focus on equipping youth younger than 25 years with employable skills.\n","permalink":"https://ramarty.github.io/publications/ugandasurvivalanalysis/","tags":null,"title":"Survival Analysis of Regional Unemployment in Uganda: Evidence from the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We describe the efforts of two related undergraduate projects to promote lasting social change in marginalized communities in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. The projects represent a test of the premise that undergraduate projects can engage academically based strategies and transcend good intentions to achieve effective community partnerships to improve health and health care. The projects proceed from a perspective and theory of marginalization and its consequences. Specifically, marginalization undermines individual and collective capacity to meet basic needs and efforts to thrive. Through strengthening social infrastructure, communities can overcome the effects of marginalization. Project work begins with annual medical clinics and, with the permission of community residents, team members conduct ethnographic descriptions of the communities and their health and health care concerns and resources. We use social network analysis (SNA) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to describe social infrastructure. Working from those foundations, both projects have enabled increased social infrastructure. To date, we have observed increased communication among community residents, facilitated the development of community-endorsed five-year plans, and established partnerships with regional and international groups.\n","permalink":"https://ramarty.github.io/publications/somos/","tags":null,"title":"Developing Conceptual and Methodological Foundations in Community Engagement"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README\u0026rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.\n","permalink":"https://ramarty.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/","tags":["Docker","Rest APIs","JavaScript","node.js","JSON"],"title":"Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io"},{"categories":null,"contents":"While adding Structured Data to a client\u0026rsquo;s website I found some example JSON that was invalid.
